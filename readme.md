üì∞ Fake News Classifier

A machine learning-based web app to classify news articles or headlines as Real ‚úÖ or Fake ‚ùå. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Project Overview

Fake news spreads rapidly online and can mislead people. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect fake news.

Dataset: Combination of True.csv and Fake.csv

Models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

Features: Text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud for easy web access

Demo

## Next Steps / Future Improvements

- **Improved Model Accuracy:** Explore advanced NLP models like BERT or RoBERTa to improve fake news detection accuracy beyond traditional TF-IDF + Naive Bayes.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Extend the classifier to detect fake news in multiple languages.
- **Article Source Verification:** Add a feature to check the credibility of the news source.
- **Browser Extension / API:** Create a browser plugin or API endpoint so users can classify news articles on-the-go.
- **UI Enhancements:** Improve the Streamlit app interface with better styling, examples, and user guidance.
- **Continuous Learning:** Implement a system to retrain the model periodically with new fake news examples to adapt to emerging patterns.
